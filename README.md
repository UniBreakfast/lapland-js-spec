# lapland-js-spec - LaplandJS backend framework specification
YAJSF (yet another JavaScript framework) I'm curious to play in development of.))
I struggled for some time trying to find the names for my modules I would actually like. Until I decided to see them as actors working on the common task - in a sense like Santa's elfs. So the whole naming theme goes from there.

## Modular structure

* Lapland - loader/starter module
* Santa - http server module
* gild - request handler function
* home - public folder with client side files
* apiBox - folder with api routes
* apiElf - module to load and handle api routes
* sesElf - module to handle sessions
* passElf - module to handle passwords
* dataElf - module to handle data storage (db etc.)
